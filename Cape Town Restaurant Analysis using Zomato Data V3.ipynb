    "# Project Overview\n",

    "\n",
    "Zomato is an mobile and web app used by foodies to find good restaurants in a ever-growing number of cities around the world. Users of the app can find a restuarant by a multitide of filters and submit ratings, review and pictures of their experience at the establishment. \n",
    "\n",
    "The intention of this analysis is to use data provided by the Zomato API to understand trends among restaurants in Cape Town specifically. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is hoped that this analysis will allow hidden gems to be dsicovered through the use of aggregated data. In adddition, restaurateurs may use this info to understand, at least partially, the relationship between ratings, location, cuisine types and price points.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations of the Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- It was intended to obtain a listing of all the reataurants in Cape Town, however the Zomato Search API limits you to 100 restaurants per search criteria. However with some trickery I was able to create two data sets - the top 100 restaurants by aggregated rating for each establishment type in Cape Town and the bottom 100 restaurants by aggregated rating for each establishment type in Cape Town. This means that although not every restaurant in Cape Town is included in the analysis, the bulk of the best and worst are, which should make the analysis insightful enough. \n",
    "\n",
    "- I was not able to access restaurant reviews, review counts, review sentiments, comments, pictures or picture counts from the API as one needs to be a Zomato Partner in order to do this. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Although rating's provided by restaurant patrons provide useful info about the combination of food, service and ambience as a whole, there is no way to extract specific details about each of these elements of the experience (at this time).\n",

    "## Observations\n",
    "- Multiple cuisine types can be specified per restaurant. These should be seperated thoughtfully so that filtering by single cuisine type will be possible. Dummy columns for each cuisine type will be created using True/False values for each. This adds a lot of columns to the data set but allows us to be more precise with filtering. It might also allow us to investigate whether having multiple cusine types on your Zomato listing contrinutes to your aggregate rating or some other measure. A column will be added to store the number of cuisine types on offer.\n",
    "- Restarants that serve \"Drinks Only\" account for the highest number of establishments yet they may skew the data thus in certain instances, they will not be included in an investigation.\n",
    "- \"Locality\" includes suburb names but also specific places of interest within certain suburbs, such as shopping malls. A new column will be created to maintain this extra info and the \"Locality\" column will be changed to show the suburb name only. This will allow us to filter on specific suburbs as a whole but also seperate out larger public spaces that have many restuarants such as the V&A Waterfront. \n",
    "- In addition to splitting suburb and places of interest, we may want to add a field showing the larger region that a suburb forms part of it. This will make aggregated and visualisation easier. \n",
    "- Restaurants that have a high or low aggregate rate based on a larger number of votes carry more useful info than restaurants whose aggregate rating comes from a few votes, hence a weighting factor column will be created so that restaurants with fewer votes will not be penalised unfairly. Restaurants that have received zero ratings will not be included in any ratings investigations however their locality, price range and average cost for two variables will be considered in other analysis. \n",
    "- Currency column contains \"R\" only, as expected, so can be removed from analysis. \n",
    "- \"has_online_delivery\" and \"is_delivering_now\" contains only 0, therefore they don't influence the analysis and will be removed. \n",
    "- \"has_table_booking\" is all 0's except for 3 restaurants in top 100 list and 2 in the bottom 100, therefore will be removed as well. \n",
    "- Rows from top and bottom data sets will be merged. This will lead to some duplicates which must be removed.\n",
    "- There are no missing values in either data set"
