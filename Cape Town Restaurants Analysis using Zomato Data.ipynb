    "# Project Overview\n",

    "\n",
    "Zomato is an mobile and web app used by foodies to find good restaurants in a ever-growing number of cities around the world. Users of the app can find a restuarant by a multitide of filters and submit ratings, review and pictures of their experience at the establishment. \n",
    "\n",
    "The intention of this analysis is to use data provided by the Zomato API to understand trends among restaurants in Cape Town specifically. \n",
    "\n",
    "It is hoped that this analysis will allow hidden gems to be dsicovered through the use of aggregated data. In adddition, restaurateurs may use this info to understand, at least partially, the relationship between ratings, location, cuisine types and price points.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Limitations of the Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "- It was intended to obtain a listing of all the reataurants in Cape Town, however the Zomato Search API limits you to 100 restaurants per search criteria. However with some trickery I was able to create two data sets - the top 100 restaurants by aggregated rating for each establishment type in Cape Town and the bottom 100 restaurants by aggregated rating for each establishment type in Cape Town. This means that although not every restaurant in Cape Town is included in the analysis, the bulk of the best and worst are, which should make the analysis insightful enough. \n",
    "\n",
    "- I was not able to access restaurant reviews, review counts, review sentiments, comments, pictures or picture counts from the API as one needs to be a Zomato Partner in order to do this. \n",
    "\n",
    "- Although rating's provided by restaurant patrons provide useful info about the combination of food, service and ambience as a whole, there is no way to extract specific details about each of these elements of the experience (at this time).\n",

    "## Observations\n",
    "- Multiple cuisine types can be specified per restaurant. These should be seperated thoughtfully so that filtering by single cuisine type will be possible. Dummy columns for each cuisine type will be created using True/False values for each. This adds a lot of columns to the data set but allows us to be more precise with filtering. It might also allow us to investigate whether having multiple cusine types on your Zomato listing contrinutes to your aggregate rating or some other measure. A column will be added to store the number of cuisine types on offer.\n",
    "- Restarants that serve \"Drinks Only\" account for the highest number of establishments yet they may skew the data thus in certain instances, they will not be included in an investigation.\n",
    "- \"Locality\" includes suburb names but also specific places of interest within certain suburbs, such as shopping malls. A new column will be created to maintain this extra info and the \"Locality\" column will be changed to show the suburb name only. This will allow us to filter on specific suburbs as a whole but also seperate out larger public spaces that have many restuarants such as the V&A Waterfront. \n",
    "- In addition to splitting suburb and places of interest, we may want to add a field showing the larger region that a suburb forms part of it. This will make aggregated and visualisation easier. \n",
    "- Restaurants that have a high or low aggregate rate based on a larger number of votes carry more useful info than restaurants whose aggregate rating comes from a few votes, hence a weighting factor column will be created so that restaurants with fewer votes will not be penalised unfairly. Restaurants that have received zero ratings will not be included in any ratings investigations however their locality, price range and average cost for two variables will be considered in other analysis. \n",
    "- Currency column contains \"R\" only, as expected, so can be removed from analysis. \n",
    "- \"has_online_delivery\" and \"is_delivering_now\" contains only 0, therefore they don't influence the analysis and will be removed. \n",
    "- \"has_table_booking\" is all 0's except for 3 restaurants in top 100 list and 2 in the bottom 100, therefore will be removed as well. \n",
    "- Rows from top and bottom data sets will be merged. This will lead to some duplicates which must be removed.\n",
    "- There are no missing values in either data set"

    "The majority of ratings lie between 2.5 and 3.5 with a mode of 3. The left tail is longer than the right, as expected since rating are capped at 5 and there are many restaurants with low scores. We can expect most restaurants to score in the 2 to 4 range based on the standard deviation however we must bear in mind that at present, there is no seperation in the data between establishments that serve full meals and drinks only. We will split the data later to get more accurate statstics. \n",

    "The average cost for two is right skewed with the majority of restaurants charging up to R250 for two people and a few charging in excess of R500. Given there are a number of fine-dining restaurants in Cape Town, we expect the top-end establishments to skew the mean slightly, so the median of R200 is a more accurate reeflection of the central cost for two people. The majority of restaurants will charge between R69 and R419 based on the standard deviation. It will be useful to break down these statistics by region, suburb and cuisine type later and see how these correlate with the overall rating. Zomato provides a price range variable which we have access to in the data set, however its not clear what defines the range of this parameter and whether its country-dependant, so we will work with raw the average costs for two for the most part and create cost ranges that make sense for a South African context. \n",

    "Most restaurants received between 0 and 50 votes and this tails off to the right. Zomato doesn't make the vote algoirthm publically available but it believed to be a weighted score whereby the vote of users' with more followers counts for more than those with less. This presumably would influence the aggregate rating of restaurants as well. The median vote count is 22 votes per restaurant with the bulk receiving 0 to 124 votes. \n",
    "\n",
    "Most restaurants serve 1 or 2 cuisine types while a few serve as many as 8 types. It will be interesting to investigate whether number of cuisine types influences ratings and if there is a correclation between more \"mass-amrket\" restaurants that serve a bit of everything and location. One might expect to see more of these restaurants in shopping malls and public places. "
